Examples of statistical analysis with sample data, for a class project [French]

## Spatial analysis and statistics
Sample data for spatial analysis originates from our own research project.

## Flow cytometry data analysis and statistics
Flow cytometry data was sampled from a public database (PMID: PMC3906045) because
preliminary data from our own project was as of yet insufficient for analysis purposes.
